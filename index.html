            <p>All programmes focus on personal learning and thinking skills such as taking responsibility for one’s own
                actions, respect, working as part of a group or team, problem solving, decision making, leading others,
                communication and negotiation.

                To help develop these and other essential life skills, we provide a safe and supportive environment
                where students can take risks and learn from their experiences.

                Our methods include:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Experiential exercises</li>
                <li> Leadership and team development theory sessions</li>
                <li>Group review</li>
                <li> Peer and tutor led feedback</li>
                <li>Individual coaching</li>
            </ul>


            <p>Reflection plays an important part in personal development. As such all participants are given the
                opportunity to reflect on their performance as a team, and as individuals. Students learn how to give
                and receive constructive feedback by reviewing their strengths, achievements, behaviour and recognising
                areas for development.</p>
